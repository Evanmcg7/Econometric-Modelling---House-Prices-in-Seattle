# Econometric-Modelling---House-Prices-in-Seattle
MatLab code is provided that was used to run a linear regression on 21,000 data points of House Prices in Seattle, USA (and the surrounding area). House Prices for the next year were then forecasted using a GARCH-Model. 

The PDF File "Assignment Report" contains visual representations and the MatLab code used for each of the steps of the Multiple Linear Regression. Additionally, it contains a detailed report with visual aids for the forecasting using the GARCH-Model.
The code for the GARCH-Model (and the tests run on this model) can be found in the "AssignmentFunctions.m" MatLab file. In case MatLab cannot be accessed I have created a .txt file of "AssignmentFunctions" which will provide all code in plain text. 
The MatLab figures used are provided in their original file form. These figures are images within the "Assignment Report".
